        <h2><a name="CompProperties"></a>View and Edit Object Properties with the 
Network Compare Tool</h2>
        <p>Within the Network Compare tool, you can view the properties of objects 
contained within the networks (referred to as Network A and Network B) that you are comparing.&#160; In 
addition, you can edit the properties of objects contained within the current 
network (Network A).</p>
        <p>Instructions fro viewing and editing properties are as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b>To view or edit the properties of an object in Network A:</b> Click on
 an object in the Objects Unique to A list or the Common Objects list.&#160; If
 necessary, click on A in the <b>Select Network</b> control beneath the 
	property grid.&#160; The properties of the object you selected will be 
	listed in the property grid.&#160; You can edit any property value that is 
	displayed in black.&#160; Properties shown in gray are status only.</p>
            <p><b>To view the properties of an object in Network B:</b> Click on an object
 in the Objects Unique to B list or the Common Objects list.&#160; If
 necessary, click on B in the <b>Select Network</b> control beneath the
 property grid.&#160; The properties of the object you selected will be
 listed in the property grid.&#160;&#160;</p>
            <p><b>To view or edit the properties of multiple objects:</b> Start by 
	selecting the desired objects from one of the three available lists (hold down the Cntl
 key and click on the desired objects or use Shift-Click to select a range of
 contiguous objects) and examine the property grid.&#160; When multiple objects 
	are selected and a property value is shown in black, then all of the 
	selected objects share the same value for that property.&#160; If multiple 
	objects are selected and a property value is blank, then one or more of the 
	selected objects has a different value for that property than the others do.&#160; To edit the 
value of a property for multiple objects in Network A, select the objects and then replace 
the existing property grid entry (blank or black) with the desired value.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="Note">Note: While the dialog does not prevent you from editing
property values in Network B, any changes you make are lost when the dialog is
closed. </p>
        <p class="Note">Note: Using this dialog to change the Name property of objects is not recommended.&#160;
Instead, close the dialog and make your edits in the property editor located at
the bottom of the Main window. </p>
