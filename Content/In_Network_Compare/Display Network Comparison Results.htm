        <h2><a name="CompTop"></a>Display Network Comparison Results</h2>
        <p>To get started with the Network Compare tool:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the Compare Networks icon <img border="0" src="../Resources/images/CompareNetworks.gif" width="6" height="17" />
    or select <b>Tools, Compare...</b> from the main menu.&#160; The dialog shown below 
 will appear.&#160; The name of the network that is currently open will be 
 listed as Network A.</li>
            <li>Select Network B, the network you wish to compare the current network to, 
 by clicking on the ellipsis button and selecting the desired file.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When these steps are complete, the dialog will display the comparison
results.&#160; Comparison results consist of lists of objects 
unique to each network, a list of objects common to both networks, and a list of
the mismatched properties of objects common to both networks.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="FigureTitle">Network Compare Dialog</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="../Resources/images/NetworkCompare1.bmp" width="935" height="553" />
        </p>
        <h3>Unique Objects</h3>
        <p>When an object is present in Network A and not present in Network B, it
appears in the Objects Unique to Network A list.&#160; Likewise, when an object
is present in Network B and not present in Network A, it appears in the Objects
Unique to Network B list.&#160; The Modeler updates these two lists whenever you
apply an <a href="Apply%20Object%20Filters.htm">object filter</a> or a 
<a href="Apply%20Property%20Filters.htm">property filter</a>
using the controls at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
        <h3>Common Objects</h3>
        <p>When an object of the same name exists in both networks, it is referred to as 
a common object.&#160; Common objects appear in the Common Objects list.&#160; 
While common objects must share the same name, the values of their remaining 
properties may differ.&#160; A common object whose property values differ 
between networks is called a mismatch.&#160; Mismatches are highlighted with the <img border="0" src="../Resources/images/Mismatch.gif" width="10" height="10" /> 
symbol.&#160;&#160; A common object whose property values are the same in both 
networks is called a match.&#160; Matches are highlighted with the <img border="0" src="../Resources/images/Match.gif" width="9" height="8" />
symbol. </p>
        <p>You can use the <b>Show</b> control at the bottom of the dialog to filter the 
Common Objects list.&#160; To select a filter, click on the type of results 
(matches, mismatches, or all) you want to include in the list.&#160; </p>
        <p>The Modeler updates the Common Objects list whenever you apply a filter using 
the <a href="Apply%20Object%20Filters.htm">object filter</a>, 
<a href="Apply%20Property%20Filters.htm">property 
filter</a>, or show control at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
        <h3>Mismatches</h3>
        <p> When a mismatch (as indicated by this symbol: <img border="0" src="../Resources/images/Mismatch.gif" width="10" height="10" />) is selected from the list of Common Objects, the Mismatches list
(top right) displays a list of the properties that differ between the two
objects.&#160; The name of each property is listed along with it's value in each
network.&#160; Using the <a href="Apply%20Property%20Filters.htm">property filter</a> control, you can filter
out properties that you want to exclude from the comparison.&#160; When all
of the properties by which two mismatched objects differ are filtered out, the
status of the pair will change from a mismatch to a match.&#160;</p>
