        <h2><a name="InstallDirStruc"></a>Directory Structure</h2>
        <p>During the installation process, you were prompted to choose a destination 
directory for the Modeler.&#160; Within the directory you chose, several 
sub-directories were created for use by the Modeler.&#160; A description of each 
sub-directory is provided in the table below.&#160; These sub-directories are 
required for the Modeler to work properly and you should not rename or delete 
any of them.&#160; You may uninstall the Modeler at any time and all of the 
files and folders written to your system during installation will be removed.&#160; 
Any new files created by you will remain behind, possibly causing the parent 
directories to remain.</p>
