        <h2><a name="top"></a>Routing Constraints</h2><span><p>Within the Modeler, constraints exist to provide you with input into the 
process of routing mesh demands.&#160; Any potential routing path that does not comply with a 
constraint is assessed a cost penalty which limits it's chances of being 
selected as the lowest cost solution.&#160; Regardless of which routing method you are using (Routing, Optimized Routing, 
or Manual Routing), you can access the Routing Constraints dialog and use it to 
specify the constraints you want applied during the route selection process.&#160;</p><p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Routing Constraint settings are maintained as 
long as the current network file remains in use.&#160; Any changes you make to 
routing constraints will impact the result of all subsequent routing operations 
(standard, manual, or optimized) until the file is closed.&#160; Routing 
constraint settings are not saved with the network file.&#160; Each time you 
open or import a network file, routing constraint settings are returned to their 
default values. </p><p>The Routing Constraints dialog is shown below.&#160; To set constraints, 
click on the desired option for each constraint, then click <b>OK</b>.&#160; The 
impact each constraint option has on the routing process is described below.</p><p class="FigureTitle">Routing Constraints Dialog</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/RoutingConstraints.bmp" width="397" height="393" /></p><h3>Constrain LightPaths By Maximum Capacity</h3><p>Select one of these three options:</p><ul><li><b>Off:</b>&#160; Maximum lightpath capacity is not factored into routing 
 decisions.</li><li><b>Hard</b>: If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause the
 lightpath to exceed maximum capacity, then that lightpath will be excluded as part of a potential solution for that demand.&#160; </li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160; If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause
 the lightpath to exceed maximum capacity, then a cost penalty is assessed on
 the lightpath making it less likely to become part of the lowest cost
 solution for that demand.&#160;</li></ul><h3>Constrain LightPaths By Minimum Capacity</h3><p>Select one of these two options:</p><ul><li><b>Off:</b>&#160; Minimum lightpath capacity is not factored into the 
 routing process.</li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160; If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause
 the lightpath to exceed minimum capacity, then a cost penalty is assessed on
 the lightpath making it less likely to become part of the lowest cost
 solution for that demand.&#160;</li></ul><h3>Constrain LightPaths By VPN</h3><p>Select one of these three options:</p><ul><li><b>Off:</b>&#160; VPN assignments are not factored into the routing 
 process.</li><li><b>Hard</b>: If a given demand has a different VPN than that of a
 lightpath, then that lightpath will be excluded as part
 of a potential solution for that demand.&#160;</li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160;If given demand has a different VPN than that of a
 lightpath, then a cost penalty is assessed on the lightpath making it less
 likely to become part of the lowest cost solution for that demand.&#160;</li></ul><h3>Constrain Locations By Through Traffic</h3><p>Select one of these three options:</p><ul><li><b>Off:</b>&#160; Through traffic property values for locations are not factored into the routing 
 process.</li><li><b>Hard</b>: If routing a given demand through a location results in it's
 through traffic requirements being violated, then
 the lightpaths associated with the location will be excluded as part
 of a potential solution for that demand.&#160;</li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160; If routing a given demand through a location results in
 it's through traffic requirements being violated, then a cost penalty is assessed on
 the lightpaths associated with the location.&#160; As a result, the affected
 lightpaths are less likely to become part of the lowest cost
 solution for that demand.&#160;<p style="margin-top: -4;margin-bottom: -4;">&#160;&#160;&#160;</p></li></ul><p class="Note"><b>Note:</b>&#160; The PermitThroughTraffic property determines
the through traffic requirements for each location.&#160; Through traffic can be
permitted on any lightpath (terminating or express) associated with a location, permitted on express
lightpaths passing through a location on it's terminating fibers, or prohibited from using any lightpath
associated with a location.</p><p>For assistance with the routing constraints described above,&#160; please contact the design tools
