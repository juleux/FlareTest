        <p><b><a name="ObjDescConduit"></a>Conduit:&#160; </b>A conduit is a number that you can assign to group 
 of fibers and/or lightpaths as a means of stating that they share a common
point of failure.&#160; What constitutes a point of failure is
strictly up to you.&#160; Examples include electrical conduit, ports,
cards, and shared power sources.&#160;</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescDemand"></a>Demand:&#160; </b>A group of point-to-point circuits of user-defined type, quantity, and
protection.&#160; During the design process, demands are routed over a sequence
of lightpaths.</p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><b><p align="LEFT"><a name="ObjDescEthernetService"></a>Ethernet Service:&#160; </p></b>
The connection of a standard Ethernet interface to a Sycamore optical switch.
</span>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescFiber"></a>Fiber:&#160; </b>An individual fiber or a set of interconnected fibers
that work as one.&#160; Fibers have user-defined start and end locations. 
Networks can be defined and routed with or without fiber information.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescLocale"></a>Locale:</b>&#160; A graphical representation of a location.&#160; Within
each network view, there is one locale object for every location object in the
network.&#160; Users determine which locales are visible and
their X-Y coordinates within the view.&#160;</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescLocalDemand"></a>Local Demand:</b>&#160; A demand that starts and ends at the same 
location. Also referred to as a local circuit.&#160; </p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescLocation"></a>Location:&#160; </b>A unique physical location where one or more nodes
exist.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescLightPath"></a>LightPath:&#160; </b>A set of fibers or conduits over which a signal travels.&#160;
LightPaths travel from a start location to an end location over a user-defined
sequence of fibers or conduits.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescNetView"></a>Network View:</b>&#160;&#160; A graphical representation of a
network.&#160; A network view contains a map of interconnected nodes with fiber,
lightpath and/or demand information superimposed on top.&#160; Network views can
be configured to display various types of network data (i.e. traffic, capacity,
routing).&#160; Network views are covered in more detail in the 
<a href="..\..\In_NetworkViews\Network%20Views.htm#NetViewTop">Network Views</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescRing"></a>Ring:</b>&#160; A set of interconnected lightpaths that form a closed loop.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescVPN0"></a>Virtual Concatenation Group (VCG):</b>&#160; A 
logical (rather than physical) combination of one or more circuits within a 
network that provide paths between two endpoint locations.&#160; To each 
endpoint location, the circuits assigned to a VCG function as a single Ethernet 
connection.</p>
        <p><b><a name="ObjDescVPN"></a>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</b>&#160; A set of fibers and/or lightpaths
that combine to form a private sub-network within a larger network.</p>
