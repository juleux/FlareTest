        <h1><a name="FailOptionsTop"></a>Advanced Failure Analysis Options</h1>
        <p>To set advanced failure analysis options, select <b> Algorithms, Mesh, Failure Analysis</b> from the main
menu and click on the Advanced tab.&#160; The dialog shown below will appear.<span></span></p><span><p>&#160;</p><hr /><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#FailOptionsTop">Back to top</a></p><p>For assistance with the algorithm options described above,&#160; please contact the design tools
team at <a href="mailto:designtools@sycamorenet.com"><MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyEmail" /></a>.</p><ul><li><b>Permit Restoration Over Rings:</b>&#160; Select this option when you 
	want to allow mesh demands to be restored over ring lightpaths.&#160; When 
	this option is selected, you must also select one or both of options listed 
	below.</li><li><b>Use Ring Working Capacity for Restoration</b>: Select this option when 
	you want to allow mesh demands to be restored using the available working 
	capacity of one or more rings.</li><li><b>Use Ring Protect Capacity for Restoration</b>: Select this option when 
	you want to allow mesh demands to be restored using the available protect 
	capacity of one or more rings.</li></ul><p>Determines if available ring capacity can be used to restore mesh demands.&#160; Select one or more of these options:</p><h3><a name="FailOptionsCombinedProtection"></a>Combined Mesh and Ring Protection</h3><ul><li><b>Show Iteration Details:</b>&#160; Select this option when you want to
 look at the results of each iteration of the failure analysis.</li><li><b>Show Restoration Paths</b>:&#160; Select this option when you want to
 view a list of the paths used to restore demands affected by a failure.</li></ul><p>Determines what, if any, additional information will be included in the
<a href="65_FailureAnalResults.htm">Failure Analysis Results</a>.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Calculates a number to represent the severity of each failure scenario based
on it's demand traffic values.&#160; Use these coefficients to rank scenarios
based on the amount of each type of demand traffic ( i.e. Mesh/Ring Restored demands,
Failed Protected demands, Failed Unprotected demands, and Unprotected OnePlusOne
demands) they contain.&#160; By increasing a Failure Severity Coefficient for a
particular type of demand traffic, you are increasing the Failure Severity
rating for each scenario that contains that type of traffic.&#160; For each
iteration that a given scenario is analyzed, the value of each type of demand
traffic is multiplied by it's corresponding coefficient.&#160; The result of
each multiplication is added together to obtain a failure severity rating for
each iteration of each scenario.&#160; When all of the iterations have been
completed, the worst-case severity value for each scenario remains.&#160;
Failure Severity ratings appear in the <b>Results, Failures</b> tab.&#160;</p><h3>Failure Severity Coefficients</h3><p>The algorithm will perform the specified number of iterations and choose the
best solution from among them.&#160; Demands are randomly sorted between iterations.&#160; Hence,
as you increase the number of&#160; iterations, the algorithm will evaluate more demand orderings
and the likelihood that additional capacity will be added to the network will
increase (assuming you did not select the Fixed at Current Capacity option).&#160; To run the algorithm&#160; indefinitely,
set the number of iterations to
zero.&#160; To stop running the algorithm, click the <b> Stop</b> button on the progress dialog.</p><h3>Iterations</h3><ul><li><b>Current Affected Demand:</b>&#160; The non-failed resources of the current
 affected demand (the demand being
 restored) are made available (released) during the restoration process for
 use by the current demand only.</li><li><b>None</b>: The most conservative option, the non-failed resources of all failed
 demands are unavailable during the restoration process.</li><li><b>All Affected Demands:</b>&#160; The most liberal option, the non-failed resources
 of all affected demands are made available (released) during the restoration
 process.</li></ul><p>Select one of these three options:</p><p>Determines the degree to which valid resources assigned to failed routes are
made available for the restoration of other demands.&#160; This option applies 
only when using Automatic Failure Analysis.&#160; </p><h3>Release Resources Before Restore</h3><ul><li><b>Fixed at Current Capacity:</b>&#160; Lightpath capacity cannot be
 increased in the process of restoring failed demands.</li><li><b>Up to Max Capacity</b>: Lightpath capacity can be increased in the process of restoring failed demands, 
	up to but not exceeding the amount of maximum capacity for the lightpath. To 
	prevent lightpaths with a capacity equal to zero (the default value) from 
	being used for restoration, click to select the <b>Ignore Zero-Capacity 
	LightPaths</b> option.</li><li><b>Unconstrained:</b>&#160; Lightpath capacity can be increased without
 restriction during the process of restoring failed demands. To prevent 
	lightpaths with a capacity equal to zero (the default value) from being used 
	for restoration, click to select the <b>Ignore Zero-Capacity LightPaths</b> 
	option.</li></ul><p>Determines what, if any action can be taken when an increase in lightpath 
capacity is required to restore a failed demand.&#160; This option applies only when using Automatic Failure Analysis.&#160; Select one of these three options:</p><h3>Increase LightPath Capacity</h3><p>Use the descriptions below to select advanced options for analyzing failures 
in your network.&#160; Each advanced option applies to both the manual and 
automatic modes of failure analysis unless stated otherwise. 
When your selections are complete, continue the failure analysis process by 
clicking on either the Manual or Automatic tab in the Failure Analysis dialog.</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/FailAnalAdv.bmp" width="721" height="444" /></p><p class="FigureTitle">Failure Analysis Dialog, Advanced Tab</p></span>
