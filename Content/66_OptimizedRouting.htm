        <h1><a name="RouteOptTop"></a>Optimized Demand Routing - Mesh</h1>
        <p>The Optimized Demand Routing algorithm combines the routing of work and 
protect paths for all demand protection types (UnProtected, OnePlusOne and 
SharedPath) with the goal of minimizing the (user-defined) cost of the network. </p>
        <p>You can run this algorithm using either default or advanced routing options.&#160; 
Default routing options are in effect from the moment you install the Modeler.&#160; 
Their values are carefully selected to provide optimum routing results for a 
majority of applications.&#160; Routing options retain their default values 
unless you elect to edit them using either the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">Advanced 
tab</a> or the <a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> 
dialog.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Once edited, default routing option values 
can be reinstated.&#160; The majority of routing options return to their default 
values upon closure of the Routing Optimization dialog, others are reset when 
the network file is closed, and still others are reset only when you click a 
button to return them to their default value.&#160; For instructions on 
reinstating the default values of routing options that have been edited, refer 
to the <a href="63_DefaultRoutingOptions.htm#DROTop">Apply Default Routing 
Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Advanced routing options are helpful in 
those rare situations where default parameters do not provide the desired 
results.&#160; Each routing option is described in the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">
Advanced Routing Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Once you have determined which options to use, follow the steps below to 
initiate the routing process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create any additional objects or object properties necessary to define 
	your network.&#160; Refer to the list of
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepMinimum">Minimum Routing Requirements</a> described in the
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepRouteTop">Preparation for
Routing</a> section of this help file. </li>
            <li>Select <b>Algorithms, Mesh, Routing Optimization</b> from the main
menu. The following dialog will
appear displaying an empty log: </li>
        </ol>

        </blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>If you want to execute the algorithm using default routing options, 
	proceed to the next step.&#160; Otherwise, click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab and 
	select the desired <a href="#RouteOptAdv">advanced routing options</a>.&#160; 
	When complete, click to return to the <b>Basic</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Calculate</b>

        </ol>
        <p>&#160; Upon initiation, the Optimized Demand Routing algorithm performs the 
tasks listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using LightPath Admin Costs, it finds an initial work path and protect 
	path (for protected demands) over the lightpath layer, taking into account 
	conduit and node diversity. Routes the demand working and protect paths over 
	the lightpath layer taking ProtectionType into account.&#160; Note that 
	demands whose FixedLightPathRouting property is set to True will not have their working and
 protect paths changed.&#160; Demands whose DoNotRoute property is set to 
	True will not be routed.</li>
            <li>Then for each
iteration, it randomly sorts the demands and re-routes the work path for
unprotected demands and the protect path for protected demands (i.e. the work
path for protected demands is not altered once the initial path is found). During this re-routing
step, the algorithm takes into account various constraints such as solution
 costs, conduit
diversity, node diversity, VPN and max capacity on lightpaths. Options for
 customizing constraints are provided on the <a href="#RouteOptAdv"> Advanced tab</a> of this
 dialog.</li>
            <li>After demands
are routed for each iteration, the Modeler updates the lightpath TrafficWorking,
TrafficProtectDedicated and TrafficProtectShared properties which are used to
calculate the lightpath's Capacity property.</li>
            <li>At the completion of each iteration, a solution cost is calculated and
 compared with the cost of the best (lowest cost) solution from all previous
 iterations.&#160; If the solution cost is the lower than the previous value,
 it becomes the standard that all subsequent solutions are compared to.&#160;
 If the solution cost is higher, it is discarded and the next iteration is
 initiated.</li>
            <li>Loads network statistics information into the log.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The appearance of network information in the log portion of the dialog is 
your signal that the routing process is complete.&#160; For tips on evaluating routing results, read the

        <h3><span>Solution Cost 
Coefficients
</span>
        </h3>
        <p><span>For each
lightpath type that exists in the current project, you can set solution cost 
coefficients. Cost coefficients are disabled for any type of lightpath that does not 
exist within the current project. There are two coefficient options for each
lightpath type: Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity
Distance. The default setting for Incremental Capacity is 1 and the default 
setting for Incremental Capacity Distance is 0. You can use any combination of 
non-negative values for coefficients.&#160; Generally however, only one coefficient type is used in 
a design (based on the
design goals).
</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Used Traffic</h3>
        <p>This cost coefficient is multiplied by the amount of used traffic for each
route under consideration.&#160;It comes into play when the algorithm is
comparing solutions which have the same required capacity/capacity distance, but
different amounts of used traffic.&#160; When this occurs, the solution with the
least amount of used traffic will have the lowest cost and will therefore be
selected as the preferred solution.</p>
        <h3>Constraint and UnRouted Demand Penalty</h3>
        <p><span>This penalty is 
imposed on a potential solution for each UnRouted Demand, each NonDiverse </span>Demand,<span>
and for each instance that a soft constraint is violated.</span></p><span><p class="BackToTopLink"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/Placeholder.gif" width="10" height="464" /></p><p class="BackToTopLink">&#160;</p><p class="BackToTopLink"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/Placeholder.gif" width="10" height="464" /></p><p class="SeeAlsoLinks"><a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepRouteTop">Preparation for Routing</a></p><p class="SeeAlsoLinks"><a href="69_EvaluateRouting.htm#EvalTop">Evaluating Routing Results</a></p><p class="SeeAlsoLinks"><a href="63_Routing.htm#RouteTop">Demand Routing</a></p><p class="SeeAlsoLinks"><a href="63_DefaultRoutingOptions.htm#DROTop">Apply Default Routing Options</a></p><p class="SeeAlsoText">See Also:&#160;<a href="In_Network_Files\Create%20an%20Excel%20File%20for%20Import.htm#NFCreateExcel">  <![CDATA[ ]]></a></p><hr /><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#RouteOptTop">Back to top</a></p><p>For assistance with the algorithm options described above,&#160; please contact the design tools
team at <a href="mailto:designtools@sycamorenet.com">designtools@sycamorenet.com</a>.</p><p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Routing Constraint settings are retained as 
long as the current network file remains open.&#160; If you have made any 
recent changes to routing constraints (regardless of which routing algorithm was 
in use), click on the <b>Routing Constraints</b> button to verify that 
constraint values reflect your current needs.&#160; </p><p>Routing constraints provide a means of setting priorities for lightpath 
selection during the routing process.&#160; Based on your constraint selections, 
penalties are applied to potential solutions that do not meet the selected 
criteria.&#160; By comparing the combined penalties for each potential solution, 
the Modeler's routing algorithms can identify the solution that best meets your 
criteria. To select 
options for routing constraints, click on the <b>Routing Constraints...</b> 
button.&#160; For a description of routing constraints, read the
<a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> section of this 
help file.</p><h3>Routing Constraints</h3><p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Diverse Routing Option settings are retained 
indefinitely unless you reset them by clicking on the <b>Defaults</b> button.&#160; 
Diverse Routing Options include Routing Algorithm, Diversity Iterations, and 
Diversity Step Size settings.</p><p>Use the <b>Defaults</b> button to return each selection in the Diverse 
Routing Options box to it's default value. Default values exist for the Use 
Broadleaf Algorithm and Use Modeler Algorithm checkboxes, for the number of 
Diversity Iterations, and for Diversity Step Size.</p><h3>Defaults</h3><p>Diversity Step Size applies to the Modeler algorithm.&#160; The optimum value
for step size (optimum being the best result in the least amount of time) can
vary greatly depending on the characteristics of a particular network.&#160; You
can use the <a href="63_Routing.htm">Route
Demands</a> algorithm to observe the impact of a range of step size values to
determine a good working value for each network.</p><h3>Diversity Step Size</h3><p>Diversity Iterations defines the maximum number of attempts to find diverse 
working and protect paths for each protected demand. The default value is 
typically sufficient to ensure diversity.&#160; However, certain topologies are 
more complex and require a greater number of diversity iterations. There are 
scenarios for which a finding a diverse route is not possible, perhaps due to 
Conduit Id settings or hard maximum capacity constraints. For these scenarios, you can 
increase the speed of the algorithm by setting
diversity iterations to a lower number.</p><h3>Diversity Iterations</h3><ul><li><b>Broadleaf:</b>&#160; A diverse routing algorithm based on <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyName" />'s
 embedded
 Broadleaf algorithm is used to route demands.</li><li><b>Modeler:</b> A diverse routing algorithm, custom developed for the
 Modeler, is used to route
 demands.&#160;</li><li><b>Both Broadleaf and Modeler:</b>&#160; The Broadleaf algorithm is
 executed first, followed by the Modeler algorithm in the event that a
 demand's routing paths are
 non-diverse.&#160;</li></ul><p>Select one of these three options:</p><h3>Diverse Routing Algorithm</h3><ul><li><b>Solution Cost:</b>&#160; As the algorithm executes, each lightpath is
 assigned a cost based on solution cost coefficients.&#160;&#160;</li><li><b>Admin Cost:</b> As the algorithm executes, each lightpath is assigned a
 cost based on it's AdminCost property.</li></ul><p>The Modeler algorithm factors lightpath cost into the routing selection
process.&#160; Select one of these two options:</p><h3>LightPath Routing Cost</h3><p>During each optimization iteration, solution cost is calculated and compared to that of
the benchmark (lowest cost) solution.&#160; The solution with the lowest cost
becomes the new benchmark to which future solutions will be compared.&#160; Demands are
randomly sorted between iterations.&#160; Hence, the more optimization iterations that the algorithm is run, the more demand sequences will be tried
and the greater the chance of finding the lowest cost solution.&#160; To run the algorithm&#160; indefinitely,
set the number of iterations to
zero.&#160; To stop running the algorithm, click the <b> Stop</b> button on the progress dialog.</p><h3>Optimization Iterations</h3></span>
