        <h1><a name="RouteOptTop"></a>Optimized Demand Routing - Mesh</h1>
        <p>The Optimized Demand Routing algorithm combines the routing of work and 
protect paths for all demand protection types (UnProtected, OnePlusOne and 
SharedPath) with the goal of minimizing the (user-defined) cost of the network. </p>
        <p>You can run this algorithm using either default or advanced routing options.&#160; 
Default routing options are in effect from the moment you install the Modeler.&#160; 
Their values are carefully selected to provide optimum routing results for a 
majority of applications.&#160; Routing options retain their default values 
unless you elect to edit them using either the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">Advanced 
tab</a> or the <a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> 
dialog.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Once edited, default routing option values 
can be reinstated.&#160; The majority of routing options return to their default 
values upon closure of the Routing Optimization dialog, others are reset when 
the network file is closed, and still others are reset only when you click a 
button to return them to their default value.&#160; For instructions on 
reinstating the default values of routing options that have been edited, refer 
to the <a href="63_DefaultRoutingOptions.htm#DROTop">Apply Default Routing 
Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Advanced routing options are helpful in 
those rare situations where default parameters do not provide the desired 
results.&#160; Each routing option is described in the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">
Advanced Routing Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Once you have determined which options to use, follow the steps below to 
initiate the routing process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create any additional objects or object properties necessary to define 
	your network.&#160; Refer to the list of
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepMinimum">Minimum Routing Requirements</a> described in the
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepRouteTop">Preparation for
Routing</a> section of this help file. </li>
            <li>Select <b>Algorithms, Mesh, Routing Optimization</b> from the main
menu. The following dialog will
appear displaying an empty log: </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="FigureTitle">Routing Optimization Dialog, Basic Tab

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>If you want to execute the algorithm using default routing options, 
	proceed to the next step.&#160; Otherwise, click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab and 
	select the desired <a href="#RouteOptAdv">advanced routing options</a>.&#160; 
	When complete, click to return to the <b>Basic</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Calculate</b> 
button on the Basic tab to execute the optimized routing algorithm.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160; Upon initiation, the Optimized Demand Routing algorithm performs the 
tasks listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using LightPath Admin Costs, it finds an initial work path and protect 
	path (for protected demands) over the lightpath layer, taking into account 
	conduit and node diversity. Routes the demand working and protect paths over 
	the lightpath layer taking ProtectionType into account.&#160; Note that 
	demands whose FixedLightPathRouting property is set to True will not have their working and
 protect paths changed.&#160; Demands whose DoNotRoute property is set to 
	True will not be routed.</li>
            <li>Then for each
iteration, it randomly sorts the demands and re-routes the work path for
unprotected demands and the protect path for protected demands (i.e. the work
path for protected demands is not altered once the initial path is found). During this re-routing
step, the algorithm takes into account various constraints such as solution
 costs, conduit
diversity, node diversity, VPN and max capacity on lightpaths. Options for
 customizing constraints are provided on the <a href="#RouteOptAdv"> Advanced tab</a> of this
 dialog.</li>
            <li>After demands
are routed for each iteration, the Modeler updates the lightpath TrafficWorking,
TrafficProtectDedicated and TrafficProtectShared properties which are used to
calculate the lightpath's Capacity property.</li>
            <li>At the completion of each iteration, a solution cost is calculated and
 compared with the cost of the best (lowest cost) solution from all previous
 iterations.&#160; If the solution cost is the lower than the previous value,
 it becomes the standard that all subsequent solutions are compared to.&#160;
 If the solution cost is higher, it is discarded and the next iteration is
 initiated.</li>
            <li>Loads network statistics information into the log.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The appearance of network information in the log portion of the dialog is 
your signal that the routing process is complete.&#160; For tips on evaluating routing results, read the
