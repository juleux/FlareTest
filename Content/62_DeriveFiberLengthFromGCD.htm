        <p>The distance between the locations in 
a network (i.e. fiber length or lightpath length) must be known in order for the Modeler's algorithms to function 
properly.&#160; Use this command to calculate the length of the fibers in a 
network based on the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of it's locations.</p>
        <p>When you execute the Derive Fiber Length From Great Circle Distance command, the Modeler calculates the great circle 
distance between each pair of locations in the network and sets fiber length 
equal to it.&#160; Great circle distance is the distance between two locations 
on the earth's surface.&#160; The Modeler calculates great circle distance using 
the Latitude and Longitude property values for each location as input.&#160; The 
curvature of the earth's surface is factored into the calculation.</p>
        <p>Using this command, fiber lengths can be set for all of the fibers in the 
network or for a group of fibers.&#160; To use this command:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Within the Object tree, click on the All Fibers object or on the name of 
	the fiber group you want to work with.&#160; </li>
            <li>Under the Commands heading in the Property Editor, locate the LengthsFromGreatCircleDistance property and select <b>True</b> from the 
	pull-down menu.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
