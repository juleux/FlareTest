        <h1><a name="RouteOptAdv"></a>Advanced Routing Options</h1>
        <p>The Advanced tab of the Routing Optimization dialog is shown below.
By making selections in this dialog, you determine which factors take precedence 
during the routing process. Your selections will also influence the amount 
of time required for the algorithm to complete it's analysis. Use the 
description of each option (included below) to determine the desired settings. 
When your selections are complete, return to the <b>Basic</b> tab and click on 
the <b>Calculate</b> button to initiate the routing process.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A description of each advanced routing option is provided below.&#160; Unless 
noted otherwise, any changes you make to option values are retained until the 
Routing Optimization dialog is closed.&#160; </p>
        <h3>Solution Cost 
Coefficients</h3>
        <p>For each
lightpath type that exists in the current project, you can set solution cost 
coefficients. Cost coefficients are disabled for any type of lightpath that does not 
exist within the current project. There are two coefficient options for each
lightpath type: Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity
Distance. The default setting for Incremental Capacity is 1 and the default 
setting for Incremental Capacity Distance is 0. You can use any combination of 
non-negative values for coefficients.&#160; Generally however, only one coefficient type is used in 
a design (based on the
design goals).</p>
        <h3>Used Traffic</h3>
        <p>This cost coefficient is multiplied by the amount of used traffic for each
route under consideration.&#160;It comes into play when the algorithm is
comparing solutions which have the same required capacity/capacity distance, but
different amounts of used traffic.&#160; When this occurs, the solution with the
least amount of used traffic will have the lowest cost and will therefore be
selected as the preferred solution.</p>
        <h3>Constraint and UnRouted Demand Penalty</h3>
        <p>This penalty is 
imposed on a potential solution for each UnRouted Demand, each NonDiverse Demand,
and for each instance that a soft constraint is violated.</p>
        <h3>Optimization Iterations</h3>
        <p>During each optimization iteration, solution cost is calculated and compared to that of
the benchmark (lowest cost) solution.&#160; The solution with the lowest cost
becomes the new benchmark to which future solutions will be compared.&#160; Demands are
randomly sorted between iterations.&#160; Hence, the more optimization iterations that the algorithm is run, the more demand sequences will be tried
and the greater the chance of finding the lowest cost solution.&#160; To run the algorithm&#160; indefinitely,
set the number of iterations to
zero.&#160; To stop running the algorithm, click the <b> Stop</b> button on the progress dialog.</p>
        <h3>LightPath Routing Cost</h3>
        <p>The Modeler algorithm factors lightpath cost into the routing selection
process.&#160; Select one of these two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Solution Cost:</b>&#160; As the algorithm executes, each lightpath is
 assigned a cost based on solution cost coefficients.&#160;&#160;</li>
            <li><b>Admin Cost:</b> As the algorithm executes, each lightpath is assigned a
 cost based on it's AdminCost property.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diverse Routing Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Select one of these three options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Broadleaf:</b>&#160; A diverse routing algorithm based on <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyName" />'s
 embedded
 Broadleaf algorithm is used to route demands.</li>
            <li><b>Modeler:</b> A diverse routing algorithm, custom developed for the
 Modeler, is used to route
 demands.&#160;</li>
            <li><b>Both Broadleaf and Modeler:</b>&#160; The Broadleaf algorithm is
 executed first, followed by the Modeler algorithm in the event that a
 demand's routing paths are
 non-diverse.&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diversity Iterations</h3>
        <p>Diversity Iterations defines the maximum number of attempts to find diverse 
working and protect paths for each protected demand. The default value is 
typically sufficient to ensure diversity.&#160; However, certain topologies are 
more complex and require a greater number of diversity iterations. There are 
scenarios for which a finding a diverse route is not possible, perhaps due to 
Conduit Id settings or hard maximum capacity constraints. For these scenarios, you can 
increase the speed of the algorithm by setting
diversity iterations to a lower number.</p>
        <h3>Diversity Step Size</h3>
        <p>Diversity Step Size applies to the Modeler algorithm.&#160; The optimum value
for step size (optimum being the best result in the least amount of time) can
vary greatly depending on the characteristics of a particular network.&#160; You
can use the <a href="63_Routing.htm">Route
Demands</a> algorithm to observe the impact of a range of step size values to
determine a good working value for each network.</p>
        <h3>Defaults</h3>
        <p>Use the <b>Defaults</b> button to return each selection in the Diverse 
Routing Options box to it's default value. Default values exist for the Use 
Broadleaf Algorithm and Use Modeler Algorithm checkboxes, for the number of 
Diversity Iterations, and for Diversity Step Size.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Diverse Routing Option settings are retained 
indefinitely unless you reset them by clicking on the <b>Defaults</b> button.&#160; 
Diverse Routing Options include Routing Algorithm, Diversity Iterations, and 
Diversity Step Size settings.</p>
        <h3>Routing Constraints</h3>
        <p>Routing constraints provide a means of setting priorities for lightpath 
selection during the routing process.&#160; Based on your constraint selections, 
penalties are applied to potential solutions that do not meet the selected 
criteria.&#160; By comparing the combined penalties for each potential solution, 
the Modeler's routing algorithms can identify the solution that best meets your 
criteria. To select 
options for routing constraints, click on the <b>Routing Constraints...</b> 
button.&#160; For a description of routing constraints, read the
<a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> section of this 
help file.</p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Routing Constraint settings are retained as 
long as the current network file remains open.&#160; If you have made any 
recent changes to routing constraints (regardless of which routing algorithm was 
in use), click on the <b>Routing Constraints</b> button to verify that 
constraint values reflect your current needs.&#160; </p>
