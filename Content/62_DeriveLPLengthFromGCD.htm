        <p>The distance between the locations in 
a network (i.e. fiber length or lightpath length) must be known in order for the Modeler's algorithms to function 
properly.&#160; Use this command to calculate the length of the lightpaths in a 
network based on the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of it's locations.&#160; 
Use of this command is valid only when there is a direct physical link between the 
start and end locations of the lightpath. In other words, using this command 
when express lightpaths are present will yield inaccurate results.&#160; When 
express lightpaths are in use, first
<a href="62_DeriveFiberLengthFromGCD.htm#DeriveLPTop">derive fiber length from great circle distance</a> 
and then <a href="62_DeriveLPFromFiber.htm#PrepLPLen">derive lightpath length from fiber length</a>.</p>
        <p>When you execute the Derive LightPath Length From Great Circle Distance 
command, the Modeler calculates the great circle 
distance between each pair of locations in the network and sets lightpath length 
equal to it.&#160; Great circle distance is the distance between two locations 
on the earth's surface.&#160; The Modeler calculates great circle distance using 
the Latitude and Longitude property values for each location as input.&#160; The 
curvature of the earth's surface is factored into the calculation.</p>
        <p>Using this command, lightpath lengths can be set for all of the lightpaths in 
the network or for a group of lightpaths.&#160; To use this command:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Within the Object tree, click on the All LightPaths object or on the 
	name of the lightpath group you want to work with.&#160; </li>
            <li>Under the Commands heading in the Property Editor, locate the LengthsFromGreatCircleDistance property and select <b>True</b> from the 
	pull-down menu.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
