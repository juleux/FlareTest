        <h2><a name="DeleteObjectTop"></a>Delete an Object</h2>
        <p>To delete an object, click to <a href="Select%20an%20Object.htm#SelectObjectTop">select</a> it and 
then press the "Delete" key.&#160;
When using the <a href="The%20Object%20Tree.htm#MainObjectTree">Object tree</a>, you can also access the delete command by
right-clicking on an object and selecting <b>Delete</b> from the pop-up
menu.&#160;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span></p>
        <p>A
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
message box will appear asking you to confirm your desire to delete.&#160; After
confirmation, </span>the Modeler<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
will delete the object and any objects related to it.&#160; Related objects are 
objects that are connected to the deleted object in some way.&#160; Examples of 
related objects include:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any object that is a child of the deleted object.&#160; When a network 
	view is deleted, the locales within it are deleted also.</li>
            <li>Any object that is linked to (routed over or through) the deleted 
	object.&#160; When a lightpath is deleted, any demands routed over it are 
	also deleted.&#160; When a location is deleted, any fibers or lightpaths 
	connected to it are also deleted.</li>
            <li>Any object that is a child of or is linked to a relative of the deleted 
	object.&#160; When a location is deleted, any lightpaths connected to it are 
	also deleted and any demands routed over the related lightpaths will also be 
	deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, it is important to exercise caution when deleting information.&#160;
When you delete objects from your network file, you can replace them by reentry
only.<span>&#160; Therefore, it is wise to frequently 
<a href="..\In_Network_Files\Save%20a%20Network%20File.htm#NFSaveFile">save</a> a backup copy of your network file.</span></p>
