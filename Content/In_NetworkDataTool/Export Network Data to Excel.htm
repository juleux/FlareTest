        <h2><a name="DataToolExport"></a>Export a Network Data Report to Excel</h2>
        <p>Using the Network Data Tool, you can select a subset of objects within your 
network and export reports that contain information about the objects you 
selected.&#160; The reports are stored in Excel format enabling you to edit 
and/or print them as desired.</p>
        <p>To create a report,
<a href="The%20Network%20Data%20Tool.htm">open</a> 
the Network Data Tool and select the <b>Reports</b> tab.&#160; Display the data you wish 
to export by following the steps outlined in the
<a href="Display%20Network%20Data.htm">Display 
Network Data</a> section of this help file.&#160; When you click on the <b>Save 
to Excel</b> 
button, any data present in the table will be copied to an Excel file and saved.&#160; 
Files are saved with filenames that reference the filename of the source 
network, as well as the date and time of export.&#160; Files are stored in the 
Documents folder created during the
<a href="..\In_Installation\Directory%20Structure.htm#InstallDirStruc">
installation</a> process.&#160; </p>
        <p>Once the export process has been initiated, you can continue to work and export 
additional report data as desired.&#160; When a report is being processed, any 
additional report requests are stored in a queue and processed in the order they 
were requested.&#160; You can display and edit the queue by selecting
<a href="..\Excel%20Export%20Queue%20Manager.htm#ExportQueueTop">Excel Export Queue Manager</a> from the <b>Tools</b> 
menu.</p>
