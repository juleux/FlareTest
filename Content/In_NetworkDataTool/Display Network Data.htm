        <p>Using the Network Data Tool, you can display detailed information about a set 
of objects of your choosing. </p>
        <p>To select an object and the type of data you want to display,
<a href="The%20Network%20Data%20Tool.htm">open</a> the Network 
Data Tool, select the <b>Reports</b> tab, and follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Select an Object Type -</b> Use the pull-down menu to select an 
	object type.&#160; When you do so, a list of objects of the type you 
	selected will appear in the <b>Filtered Objects</b> list.</li>
            <li><b>Select a Filter (optional) - </b>If the list of objects to select 
	from is extensive, you have the option of applying one or more filters to 
	pare down the list and make the task of locating objects easier.&#160; Each object type has its own set of 
	filters to choose from.&#160; Examples include group name, type, and start 
	location.&#160; For instructions on applying a filter, read the
	<a href="Filter%20Network%20Data.htm">Filter Network Data</a> section of this help 
	file.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Select an Object(s) -</b> Click to select an object from the list or select multiple objects by 
	holding down the Cntl or Shift key while you click.&#160; To select the 
	entire list, click on the <b>Select All</b> button at the bottom of the 
	dialog.&#160; To clear your selections, click on the <b>Clear All</b> button 
	at the bottom of the dialog.</li>
