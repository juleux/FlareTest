        <h1><a name="RingTop"></a>Dimensioning Rings</h1>
        <p>The Ring Dimensioning algorithm routes demands with the goal of minimizing either the total network capacity (i.e. OC-48)
or capacity-distance (i.e. OC-48-mi.). This minimization is achieved by
repeatedly removing and re-routing each ring demand on the best path available to
that demand. The algorithm takes into account both the working and protect
capacity needed on each ring for that demand.&#160; The algorithm will consider
all defined rings, but depending on the topology and demand set, it will not necessarily use all rings.</p>
        <p>You can run the Dimension Rings algorithm using either default or advanced 
dimensioning options.&#160; 
Default ring dimensioning options are in effect from the moment you install the Modeler.&#160; 
Their values are carefully selected to provide optimum routing results for a 
majority of applications.&#160; Ring dimensioning options retain their default values 
unless you elect to edit them using the <a href="#RingAdv">Advanced 
tab</a> 
dialog.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Advanced dimensioning options are reset to 
their default values upon closure of the Dimension Rings dialog.</p>
        <p>Advanced 
dimensioning options are helpful in 
those rare situations where default parameters do not provide the desired 
results.&#160; Each dimensioning option is described in the <a href="#RingAdv">Advanced 
Dimensioning Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Once you have determined which options to use, follow the steps below to 
initiate the dimensioning process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create any additional objects or object properties necessary to define 
	your network.&#160; Refer to the list of
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepMinimum">Minimum Routing Requirements</a> described in the
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepRouteTop">Preparation for
Routing</a> section of this help file. </li>
            <li>Select <b>Algorithms, Rings, Dimension Rings</b> from the main
menu. The following dialog will
appear displaying an empty log: </li>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>If you want to execute the algorithm using default dimensioning options, 
	proceed to the next step.&#160; Otherwise, click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab and 
	select the desired <a href="#RingAdv">advanced dimensioning options</a>.&#160; 
	When complete, click to return to the <b>Basic</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Calculate</b> 
button on the Basic tab to execute the dimensioning algorithm.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon initiation, the Dimension Rings algorithm will perform the tasks 
listed below for all ring demands that are enabled for routing.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Routes the demand working and protect paths over the lightpath layer.&#160; 
	Note that demands whose FixedLightPathRouting property is set to True or 
	whose DoNotRoute property is set to True will not be routed.&#160; Demands are routed based on lightpath admin
 costs.</li>
            <li>Updates the lightpath TrafficWorking, TrafficProtectDedicated and
 TrafficProtectShared properties which are used to calculate the lightpath
 Capacity property.</li>
            <li>Loads network statistics information into the log.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The appearance of network information in the log portion of the dialog is 
your signal that the dimensioning process is complete.&#160; For tips on evaluating routing results, read the

        <h2><a name="RingAdv"></a>Advanced Dimensioning Options</h2>
        <p>The Advanced tab of the Ring Dimensioning dialog is shown below.<span>&#160;
By making selections in this dialog, you determine which factors take precedence 
during the dimensioning process.&#160; Your selections will also influence the amount 
of time required for the algorithm to complete it's analysis.&#160; Use the 
description of each option (included below) to determine the desired settings.&#160; 
When your selections are complete, return to the <b>Basic</b> tab and click on 
the <b>Calculate</b> button to initiate the dimensioning process.</span></p>

        </p>
        <p><span>
A description of each advanced routing option is provided below.&#160; Any changes you make to option values are retained until the 
Ring Dimensioning dialog is closed.&#160;

        <h3>Minimize LightPath</h3>
        <p>By default, Modeler makes routing decisions with the goal of minimizing total
lightpath capacity.&#160; As an alternative, Modeler can make routing decisions
with the goal of minimizing total lightpath capacity distance.&#160;</p>
        <h3>Clear Routing and Statistics</h3>
        <p>This option determines whether existing routing information will be deleted
prior to running this algorithm.&#160; As the algorithm runs, each potential
solution is compared to the 'Initial Solution' and the least cost result is
retained.&#160; This result becomes the 'Initial Solution' to which subsequent
solutions are compared.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p> When this option is unchecked (default), the solution that existed prior to
running the algorithm is used as the 'Initial Solution'.&#160; When this option
is checked, the algorithm does not use the pre-existing solution as it's
'Initial Solution'.&#160; Use this option when you want to route all of the
demands to arrive at a new solution.&#160; For example, in situations, such as
adding more demand to the network, that will naturally require a more expensive
solution than the pre-existing one.</p>
        <h3>Delete Rings Without Traffic</h3>
        <p>When checked, rings without traffic will be deleted after the dimensioning
process is complete.</p><span><h3>Iterations</h3><p>During each iteration, solution's capacity/capacity distance is calculated
and compared to that of the benchmark (lowest capacity/capacity distance)
solution.&#160; The solution with the lowest capacity/capacity distance becomes
the new benchmark to which future solutions will be compared.&#160;
Demands are randomly sorted between iterations.&#160; Hence, the more
iterations that the algorithm is run, the more demand sequences will be tried
and the greater the chance of finding the lowest capacity/capacity distance
solution.&#160; To run the algorithm&#160; indefinitely,
set the number of iterations to
zero.&#160; To stop running the algorithm, click the <b> Stop</b> button on the progress dialog.</p></span>
