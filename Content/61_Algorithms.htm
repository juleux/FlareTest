        <h2><a name="AlgDijkstra"></a>The Routing Algorithm - Modified Dijkstra</h2>
        <p>The Modeler uses a modified version of the Dijkstra algorithm to determine how to
route Demand Paths over the LightPath layer. Each LightPath and Fiber has a mirrored set of directed Forward and
Reverse Edges that connect its Start and End Locations together. Each Edge has its own Cost and Relaxed properties that are manipulated by
various Modeler algorithms.</p>
        <p>When a LightPath is relaxed both of its Edges are relaxed, along with all of
the Fibers it is hosted by. When a Fiber is relaxed both of its Edges are also
relaxed. When a Fiber Edge is relaxed any LightPath Edges hosted by it are also
relaxed. When a LightPath Edge is
relaxed prior to running the modified Dijkstra algorithm, the LightPath Edge
will not be included in a Working or Protect Path between Start and End
Locations.</p>
        <p>Locations also have a relaxed property. When a Location is relaxed before running the modified Dijkstra Algorithm
all LightPath Edges beginning or ending at the Location will not be included in
a Working or Protect Path between Start and End Locations.</p>

        <h2><a name="AlgDesignProcess"></a>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>The process for creating a network design using the Modeler consists of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use one of several methods to 
	<a href="In_Network_Files\Create%20a%20Network%20File.htm#NFCreateFile">create
 a Network file</a>.
  </li>
            <li>Route the network using the appropriate set of algorithms (<a href="#AlgMesh">mesh</a>,
	<a href="#AlgRing">ring</a>, or a combination of both) as described below.</li>
            <li>Use various tools within the Modeler to analyze your design and make 
	changes as needed.</li>
            <li>Use the 
	<a href="In_Generating_Reports\Generating%20Reports.htm#ReportTop">Reporting 
	Tool</a> or the <a href="In_NetworkDataTool">Network Data Tool</a> to generate the desired Excel reports.
</li>
