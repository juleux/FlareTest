        <h1><a name="RouteTop"></a>Demand Routing - Mesh</h1>
        <p>The Route Demands algorithm combines the routing of work and 
protect paths for all demand protection types (UnProtected, OnePlusOne and 
SharedPath). </p>
        <p>You can run the Route Demands algorithm using either default or advanced routing options.&#160; 
Default routing options are in effect from the moment you install the Modeler.&#160; 
Their values are carefully selected to provide optimum routing results for a 
majority of applications.&#160; Routing options retain their default values 
unless you elect to edit them using either the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">Advanced 
tab</a> or the <a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> 
dialog.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p class="Note"><b>Note:&#160; </b>Once edited, default routing option values 
can be reinstated.&#160; The majority of routing options return to their default 
values upon closure of the Route Demands dialog, others are reset when 
the network file is closed, and still others are reset only when you click a 
button to return them to their default value.&#160; For instructions on 
reinstating the default values of routing options that have been edited, refer 
to the <a href="63_DefaultRoutingOptions.htm#DROTop">Apply Default Routing 
Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Advanced routing options are helpful in 
those rare situations where default parameters do not provide the desired 
results.&#160; Each routing option is described in the <a href="#RouteOptAdv">
Advanced Routing Options</a> section of this help file.</p>
        <p>Once you have determined which options to use, follow the steps below to 
initiate the routing process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create any additional objects or object properties necessary to define 
	your network.&#160; Refer to the list of
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepMinimum">Minimum Routing Requirements</a> described in the
	<a href="62_PrepRoute.htm#PrepRouteTop">Preparation for
Routing</a> section of this help file. </li>
            <li>Select <b>Algorithms, Mesh, Route Demands</b> from the main
menu. The following dialog will
appear displaying an empty log: </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>If you want to execute the algorithm using default routing options, 
	proceed to the next step.&#160; Otherwise, click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab and 
	select the desired <a href="#RouteOptAdv">advanced routing options</a>.&#160; 
	When complete, click to return to the <b>Basic</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Calculate</b> 
button on the Basic tab to execute the routing algorithm.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon initiation, the Route Demands algorithm will perform the tasks 
listed below for all mesh demands that are enabled for routing.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Routes the demand working and protect paths over the lightpath layer 
	taking ProtectionType into account.&#160; Note that demands whose FixedLightPathRouting property 
	is set to True will not have their working and
 protect paths changed.&#160; Demands whose DoNotRoute property is set to 
	True will not be routed.&#160; Demands are routed based on lightpath admin
 costs.</li>
            <li>Updates the lightpath TrafficWorking and TrafficProtectDedicated properties which are used to calculate the lighpath
 Capacity property.&#160; The TrafficProtectShared property is set equal to
 zero for all lightpaths.</li>
            <li>Updates the ConduitDiverse and NodeDiverse properties.</li>
            <li>Lists any UnRouted and NonDiverse Demands in the Results window.</li>
            <li>Loads network statistics information into the log.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The appearance of network information in the log portion of the dialog is 
your signal that the routing process is complete.&#160; For tips on evaluating routing results, read the

        <h2><a name="RouteAdv"></a>Advanced Routing Options</h2>
        <p>The Advanced tab of the Routing Optimization dialog is shown below.<span>&#160;
By making selections in this dialog, you determine which factors take precedence 
during the routing process.&#160; Your selections will also influence the amount 
of time required for the algorithm to complete it's analysis.&#160; Use the 
description of each option (included below) to determine the desired settings.&#160; 
When your selections are complete, return to the <b>Basic</b> tab and click on 
the <b>Calculate</b> button to initiate the routing process.</span></p>

            <img border="0" src="Resources/images/RouteAdv.bmp" width="468" height="328" />
        </p><span><p>A description of each advanced routing option is provided below.&#160; Unless 
noted otherwise, any changes you make to option values are retained until the 
Route Demands dialog is closed.&#160; </p></span>
        <h3>Diverse Routing Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Select one of these three options:</p>
        <ul><span><li><b>Broadleaf:</b>&#160; A diverse routing algorithm based on <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyName" />'s
 embedded Broadleaf algorithm is used to route demands.</li><li><b>Modeler:</b> A diverse routing algorithm, custom developed for the
 Modeler, is used to route
 demands.&#160;</li><li><b>Both Broadleaf and Modeler:</b>&#160; The Broadleaf algorithm is
 executed first, followed by the Modeler algorithm in the event that a demand</li></span>'s
 routing paths are <span>non-diverse.&#160;
</span></ul>
        <h3>Diversity Iterations</h3>
        <p><span>The value of Diversity Iterations is used by
the Modeler algorithm.&#160; Diversity Iterations defines the maximum 
number of attempts to find diverse working and protect paths for each protected 
demand. The default value is typically sufficient to ensure diversity.&#160; 
However, certain topologies are more complex and require a greater number of 
diversity iterations. There are scenarios for which a finding a diverse route is 
not possible, perhaps due to Conduit Id settings or hard maximum capacity 
constraints. For these scenarios, you can increase the speed of the algorithm by setting
diversity iterations to a lower number.</span>
        </p>
        <h3><span>Diversity Step Size</span>
        </h3>
        <p><span>Diversity Step Size applies to the Modeler
algorithm.&#160; The optimum value for step size (optimum being the best result
in the least amount of time) can vary greatly depending on the characteristics
of a particular network.&#160; To determine a good working value for your
network, run the Route
Demands algorithm with a range of step size values and observe the impact on
routing results.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Defaults</h3>
        <p>Use the <b>Defaults</b> button to return each selection in the Diverse 
Routing Options box to it's default value. Default values exist for the Use 
Broadleaf Algorithm and Use Modeler Algorithm checkboxes, for the number of 
Diversity Iterations, and for Diversity Step Size.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Note"><span><b>Note:&#160; </b>Diverse 
Routing Option settings are retained indefinitely unless you reset them by 
clicking on the <b>Defaults</b> button.&#160; Diverse Routing Options include 
Routing Algorithm, Diversity Iterations, and Diversity Step Size settings.</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Routing Constraints</h3>
        <p><span>Routing constraints provide a means of 
setting priorities for lightpath selection during the routing process.&#160; 
Based on your constraint selections, penalties are applied to potential 
solutions that do not meet the selected criteria.&#160; By comparing the 
combined penalties for each potential solution, the Modeler's routing algorithms 
can identify the solution that best meets your criteria. To select options for 
routing constraints, click on the <b>Routing Constraints...</b> 
button.&#160; For a description of routing constraints, read the
<a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> section of this 
help file.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Note"><span><b>Note:&#160; </b>Routing Constraint settings are 
retained as 
long as the current network file remains open.&#160; If you have made any 
recent changes to routing constraints (regardless of which routing algorithm was 
in use), click on the <b>Routing Constraints</b> button to verify that 
constraint values reflect your current needs.&#160; 

</span>
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20;">Detailed Log</h3>
        <p>When checked, the log will include various property values used by Modeler's
routing algorithms while evaluating each demand's working and protect paths. This information is primarily intended to assist
Modeler software
developers with debugging algorithms.&#160; This is a resource intensive feature
and should remain unchecked for most
network design projects.</p>
        <h3><a name="RouteAdvSortDemands"></a>Randomly Sort Demands</h3><span><p>When checked (checked is the default),
demands will be sorted in a random fashion prior to the algorithm being
run.&#160; When more than one demand in a network is eligible to be routed over
the same path, the order in which the routing algorithm processes demands will
influence the outcome.&#160;&#160;</p></span>
