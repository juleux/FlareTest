        <h1><a name="NetViewTop"></a>Network Views</h1>
        <p>A network view is a graphical representation (bird's eye view) of a network
design.&#160; The Modeler provides network views to help you manage the large
amounts of data needed to design a network.&#160; By creating multiple views
each configured to display different types of network data, you can filter out
the information that is important to you and speed up the design process.&#160;
When a new project is created in Modeler, it contains a default view for each
layer of information; fiber, lightpath, and demand.</p>
        <p>The following applies to network views:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: -2;">
            <li>Each network view contains a map of locales (one or more nodes) as a base layer.&#160;
 You can display additional layers showing the fibers, lightpaths and/or
 demands that interconnect your network's locales.&#160;</li>
            <li>You can <a href="Creating%20a%20Network%20View.htm">create</a> multiple views of the same network.</li>
            <li>You can <a href="Using%20the%20Pan%20and%20Zoom%20Window.htm">pan and zoom</a> within a 
	network view.&#160;</li>
            <li>You can <a href="Customizing%20Network%20Views.htm">customize</a> the appearance of a 
	network view by editing it's properties,
 layout, or scale.&#160;</li>
            <li>You can <a href="Synchronizing%20Network%20Views.htm">synchronize</a> one or more 
	network views to a selected (base) view.&#160;
 Synchronization changes a network view's layout (locale coordinates, visibility, and
 icon properties) to match that of the base view.</li>
            <li>You can <a href="..\In_Printing\Printing%20Network%20Views.htm">print</a> one or more network views.</li>
        </ul>
