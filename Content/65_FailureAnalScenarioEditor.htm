    <body><span><h1><a name="FailScenTop"></a>Failure Scenarios</h1><p>The Modeler provides a set of tools for creating and using failure
scenarios.&#160; A failure scenario is simply a list of objects (conduits,
fibers, locations, or lightpaths), within a network that are tagged for
failure.&#160; By creating one or more failure scenarios and then running the
Failure Analysis algorithm, you can model the impact the object failures will
have on your network as designed.&#160; You can then use this information as
input to the design process.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Tools are provided to <a href="#FailScenEdit">create and edit scenarios</a>
and to <a href="#FailScenCompare">compare</a> the scenarios of a set of
networks.&#160;</p><h2><a name="FailScenEdit"></a>Create and Edit Failure Scenarios</h2><p>Use the Failure Scenario Editor to create your own set of failure scenarios
for analysis.&#160; Failure scenarios can be created in one of two ways; <a href="#FailScenManual"> manual</a>
or <a href="#FailScenAuto">automatic</a>.&#160; You can use one or both of these methods to create and save
a unique set of failures for your network.&#160; To access this tool, select <b>Algorithms, Mesh, Failure 
Analysis </b>from
the main menu.&#160; When the Failure Analysis dialog appears, click on the <b> Scenario Editor</b> tab.&#160;</p><h3><a name="FailScenManual"></a>Manually Create and Edit a Failure Scenario</h3><p>The manual approach to creating a failure scenario involves selecting the
individual objects whose failures you want to analyze.&#160;&#160;</p><p><b>To create a new scenario:</b>&#160; Click on the <b>New</b> button.&#160;
A scenario with the default name FailureScenario will be added to the list of
scenarios (right).&#160;&#160;</p><p><b>To add one or more objects to a scenario:&#160;</b></p><ol><li>Click to select the scenario from the list (right) you want to add an
 object to.</li><li>Use the radio buttons to select the type of object you want to add.&#160;
 When you make a selection, objects of the type you selected will be listed
 directly above.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Click to select an object from the list for transfer or use Shift-Click or
 Cntl-Click to select multiple objects.</li><li>Click on the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> button (top) to transfer your selection(s) to the
 list of scenarios (right).</li></ol><p><b>To add one or more objects to every scenario:&#160;</b></p><ol><li>Use the radio buttons to select the type of object you want to add.&#160;
 When you make a selection, objects of the type you selected will be listed
 directly above.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Click to select an object from the list for transfer or use Shift-Click or
 Cntl-Click to select multiple objects.</li><li>Click on the <b>&gt;All</b> button to transfer your selection(s) to every 
	scenario listed on the right. </li></ol><p><b>To remove an object from a scenario:</b>&#160;&#160;</p><ol><li>Click to select the object from the scenario list (right).&#160;</li><li>Click on the <b>&lt;&lt; </b>button to remove the selected object from the list.</li></ol><p class="FigureTitle">Failure Analysis - Scenario Editor</p><p><img border="0" src="Resources/images/FailAnalScenarioEditor.bmp" width="833" height="574" /></p><h3><a name="FailScenAuto"></a>Automatically Create Failure Scenarios</h3><p>Unlike the manual approach to creating failure scenarios by identifying 
individual objects for failure, the automatic approach creates a single failure 
scenario for each object of the type (conduit, location, fiber, or lightpath) 
you select. It also gives you the option of creating double failure scenarios 
with the added selection of a second object type.&#160; Double failure scenarios 
enable you to simulate the simultaneous failure of two objects of the same or of 
different types.&#160; The automatic portion of the tool creates a double 
failure scenario for every possible combination of objects of each of the two 
types you specify.&#160; For example, if you set <b>First Object Type</b> equal 
to Fibers and <b>Second Object Type</b> equal to LightPaths, a failure scenario 
will be created to fail every fiber-lightpath combination.</p><p><b>Object Types for Automatic Failure Scenarios include:</b></p><ul><li><b>Conduit:</b>&#160; A failure scenario is created for each conduit that contains one or more mesh lightpaths.</li><li><b>Location:</b>&#160; A failure scenario is created for each location
 that terminates a mesh lightpath or has a mesh lightpath express through it
 on it's terminating fibers.&#160;</li><li><b>Fiber:</b>&#160; A failure scenario is created for each fiber that
 has one or more mesh lightpaths routed over it.</li><li><b>LightPath:</b>&#160; A failure scenario is created for each
 mesh lightpath.&#160;</li></ul><p><b>To create single or double failure scenarios automatically:</b>&#160;</p><ol><li>Use the <b>First Object Type </b>pull-down (bottom left of the dialog) 
	to select the first type of object you want to create failure scenarios for.</li><li>If you want to create double failure scenarios to simulate two objects 
	failing at the same time, use the <b>Second Object Type</b> pull-down to 
	select the second type of object you want to create failure scenarios for.&#160; 
	For single failure scenarios using only the first object type, set the <b>
	Second Object Type</b> to None.</li><li>Click on the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> button (bottom) to create a failure scenario for 
	every combination of the two object types you selected.&#160; Once there, 
	you can edit them as desired using the <a href="#FailScenManual">manual 
	controls</a> described above.</li></ol><h3><a name="FailScenRename"></a>Rename a Failure Scenario</h3><p>To rename a failure scenario, click to select the desired scenario from the
list (right).&#160; Next, click on the scenario a second time to enable the text
editor.&#160; Edit the name as desired and hit the Enter key.</p><h3><a name="FailScenDelete"></a>Delete a Failure Scenario</h3><p>To delete a single failure scenario, select the desired scenario from the
list (right) and click on the <b>Delete Selection </b>button at the bottom of
the dialog.</p><p>To delete the entire list of failure scenarios, click on the <b>Clear All</b>
button at the bottom of the dialog.</p><h3><a name="FailScenSave"></a>Save the List of Failure Scenarios</h3><p>To save the current list of failure scenarios, click on the <b>Save To
Network</b> button at the bottom of the dialog.&#160; When you do so, any
ongoing edits you make to the list will be retained (regardless of how often you
close and reopen the Failure Analysis dialog or how many edits you make) until
the <b>Clear All</b> button is pressed.&#160; To retain the list indefinitely,
you must click
on the <b>Save To Network</b> button and then 
<a href="In_Network_Files\Save%20a%20Network%20File.htm#NFSaveFile">save</a>
the network file itself.</p><p class="Note"><b>Note</b>:&#160; Use the <b>Save To Network</b> feature to
store the set of failure scenarios you use most frequently to analyze your
network.&#160; When you want to create a different set of scenarios to test out
a potential design change, use the <b>Clear All</b> button to delete the
existing list and then use the dialog controls to generate a new list.&#160; As
long as you don't click on the <b>Save to Network</b> button, your original list
will be reinstated each time you close and reopen the Failure Analysis dialog.</p><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#FailScenTop">Back to top</a></p><hr /><h2><a name="FailScenCompare"></a>Compare Failure Scenarios&#160;</h2><p>You can compare the failure scenarios of the current network to a second
network of your choosing.&#160; To do so, open the 
<a href="In_Network_Compare\Compare%20Networks.htm#CompNetTop">Network
Compare</a> tool by clicking on the Compare Networks icon <img border="0" src="Resources/images/CompareNetworks.gif" width="6" height="17" />
    or selecting <b>Tools, Compare...</b> from the main menu.&#160;Then follow
these steps:</p><ol><li>Select the network you want to compare scenarios with.</li><li>If the object filter for Failure Scenarios has a checkmark next to it, 
	disable the filter by removing the checkmark. When the filter is disabled, failure scenario information will be 
	included in the Objects Unique to A/B and Common Objects lists.</li><li>To filter an object type out of the comparison, click on the <b>Failure
 Scenario</b> tab (bottom left) and place a checkmark next to the desired
 object type(s).</li></ol><p class="Note">Note:&#160; Failure Scenarios must be <a href="#FailScenSave">saved
to the network </a> in order for the Compare Network tool to detect them.</p><p class="FigureTitle">Compare Networks - Failure Scenarios</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/NetCompareFA.bmp" /></p><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#FailScenTop">Back to top</a></p><hr /></span>
