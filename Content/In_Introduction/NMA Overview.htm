        <h2><a name="Overview"></a>Introduction to the Network Modeling Application</h2>
        <p><span>The Network Modeling Application (Modeler, NMA) is a member of the <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.ProductFamily" /> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt;FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman';">™</span>
family of network design tools.&#160; Its purpose is to aid designers with the
task of converting a set of traffic forecast requirements into a budgetary network design.&#160;
The Modeler<span>
streamlines the process of finding the best case design - </span><span>one
in which capacity and protection requirements are satisfied and cost is
minimized.</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>The Modeler consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A network object model for creating mesh and/or ring designs using conduits, locations, fibers, lightpaths, rings, and demands.</li>
            <li>The ability to import data from a functioning network via <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanionProduct" />.</li>
            <li>A variety of tools for analyzing, comparing, and editing network data.&#160; 
	Using these tools, designers can vary network parameters and evaluate the 
	effect on performance and cost.</li>
            <li>A graphical overview (network view) of network information.&#160; The 
	network view is updated throughout the design process to provide immediate 
	feedback on the impact of design changes.</li>
            <li>A set of sophisticated algorithms to route demands, optimize shared protection, perform failure
 analysis, create rings, and dimension
 rings.</li>
            <li>A variety of reporting tools that can be used to analyze and/or document 
	a design or to export network data to Excel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of the above is described in greater detail throughout this help file.</p>
        <p>The Modeler<span><span> is intended for use by <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyName" /> system engineers, channel partners,
customer service engineers, and by clients implementing <MadCap:variable name="Modeler.CompanyName" /> network 
designs.&#160; A basic understanding
of both optical networking and of the Windows environment is required to use 
this tool.&#160;</span></span></p>
