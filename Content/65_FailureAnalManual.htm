        <h1><a name="ManualFailTop"></a>Manual Failure Analysis</h1>
        <p>Use the Manual Failure Analysis tool when you want to analyze the impact of a
set of failures while maintaining control over the order in which failures and
repairs occur.&#160; All manual failures are evaluated and repaired based on two 
assumptions.&#160; The first assumption is that lightpath capacity is fixed.&#160; 
The second assumption is that <span>non-failed 
resources of all failed demands can be used during the repair process.</span></p>
        <p>Prior to running this algorithm, the network must contain at least some 
demand routing information (acquired by running a routing algorithm or via 
import from Silvx Manager).&#160;&#160; The Failure Analysis algorithm uses the working path (for
Unprotected and SharedPath demands) and 
protect path (for OnePlusOne demands) assigned to each demand to analyze 
failures.&#160; Any un-routed demands in the network are ignored by the 
algorithm.</p>
        <p>The process for performing a manual failure analysis is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Failure Analysis dialog by selecting <b>Algorithms, Mesh, Failure
 Analysis</b> from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Use the <a href="65_FailureAnalScenarioEditor.htm#FailScenEdit"> Failure Scenario Editor</a> to create the scenarios you want to
 analyze.</li>
            <li>Click on the <a href="65_FailureAnalAdvancedOptions.htm#FailOptionsTop">Advanced</a> tab to select advanced options for manual failure 
	analysis or skip this step and use the default options.</li>
            <li>Click to select the Manual tab.&#160;&#160;</li>
            <li>Use the manual controls described below to select the scenarios you want
 to analyze and step through the desired sequence of failures and repairs.</li>
            <li>Use the <a href="65_FailureAnalResults.htm#FailResultsTop"> Results</a> tab to evaluate the impact of failures and repairs as
 you progress through your analysis sequence.&#160; If a network view is 
	open, it will be updated to reflect the status of the network as each change 
	occurs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refer to the sections that follow for detailed information on using the
Manual Failure Analysis tool to <a href="#ManualFailAnalyze">select the scenarios</a>
that will undergo <a href="#ManualFailFail">failure </a>and <a href="#ManualFailRepair">repair</a>.</p>

        <h2><a name="ManualFailAnalyze"></a>Select Scenarios to Analyze</h2>
        <p>When you click on the Manual tab, a list of the failure scenarios available
for selection appears.&#160; To select a scenario, click on it's name.&#160; 
Multiple scenarios can be selected by holding down the Cntl or Shift keys while 
you click on the desired scenario names.&#160; When your selection is complete, click on the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> 
button.&#160; The scenario(s) you chose will now be appear in the
"To Fail" list of scenarios.&#160; To remove a scenario from the 
selection list, click on
it's name in the "To Fail" column followed by the <b>&lt;&lt; </b>
button. </p>

        <h2><a name="ManualFailFail"></a> Fail Scenarios</h2>
        <p>To perform a manual failure, you must first <a href="#ManualFailAnalyze">
create a list of the scenario(s) you wish to fail</a>.&#160; When your list is complete, click on the
<b>Calculate</b>
button at the bottom of the Manual tab in the Failure Analysis dialog.&#160; When you do so, the algorithm will
perform the failures listed in the "To Fail" column (along with any 
selected repairs in the "To Repair" column) and update both the Results tab and 
the network view.&#160; The list of failed scenarios will move to the "To 
Repair" column within the Manual tab.&#160; Note that all of the failure 
scenarios in the "To Fail" list will be failed as a group.&#160;</p>

        <p>To perform a manual repair, you must first <a href="#ManualFailFail">fail the 
scenario(s) that you wish to repair</a>. To select a scenario for repair, click on it's name in the "To
Repair" list.&#160; Multiple scenarios can be selected for repair by holding
down the Cntl or Shift keys while you click on the desired scenario names.&#160; When your list
is complete, click on the <b>Calculate</b> button.&#160; When you do so,
the algorithm will perform the selected repairs (along with any failures listed 
in the "To Fail" column) and update both the Results
tab and the network view.&#160; The list of repaired scenarios will return to the "To Select From" 
column within the Manual tab.&#160; To return the Manual tab to it's original 
state upon opening, click on the <b>Reset</b> button.</p><span><p class="FigureTitle">Failure Analysis Dialog, Manual Tab - Repair Scenarios</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/FailAnalManualRepair.bmp" width="805" height="395" /></p><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#ManualFailTop">Back to top</a></p><hr /><p class="BackToTopLink">&#160;</p></span>
