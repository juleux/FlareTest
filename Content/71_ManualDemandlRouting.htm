        <h2><a name="ManRouteOpen"></a>Open the Manual Demand Routing Tool</h2>
        <p>To access the Manual Demand Routing tool:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on a demand name in the Object tree.</li>
            <li>Locate the WorkingPath property (or the ProtectPath property) and click on it.&#160;
 A button with <b>…</b> in it will appear on the right edge of the box.</li>
            <li>Click on the <b>ellipsis …</b> button (as shown below).</li>
            <li>The manual routing dialog will appear.&#160; The dialog will display 
	any existing routing information for the demand you selected.&#160; </li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>A sample Manual Routing dialog is shown below.&#160; It contains the two 
lists described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>CurrentLocation LightPaths - </b>Within this tool, current location 
	refers to the location that is the starting point of the current hop.&#160; 
	The CurrentLocation LightPaths list contains the set of the lightpaths that 
	connect to the current location. Lightpaths are ranked top to bottom by 
	cost.&#160; Each time a lightpath is selected, this list is updated to 
	reflect the change in the current location.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Path LightPaths -</b> This list contains the set of lightpaths that 
	have been selected to form the proposed route.&#160; Lightpaths are listed 
	in the order that they are selected.&#160; The list is considered complete 
	when it's start and end points match those of the demand being routed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a name="ManRouteConstraint"></a>Apply Routing and Diversity Constraints</h2>
        <p><span>Routing and diversity constraints provide a means of 
setting priorities for lightpath selection during the routing process.&#160; 
Potential lightpath selections that violate a hard constraint are not made 
available for selection in the CurrentLocation LightPaths list.&#160; When soft constraints are specified, a cost 
penalty is applied to any potential lightpath selection that is in violation.&#160;By comparing the combined penalties for each potential selection, you can 
identify the lightpath that best meets all of your criteria.&#160; Lightpaths 
that violate soft constraints appear in the CurrentLocation LightPaths list in 
red text. </span>
        </p>
        <p>The Modeler includes routing constraints<span> for 
a lightpath's maximum capacity, minimum capacity, VPN, and through traffic 
requirements.&#160; To select options for 
routing constraints, click on the <b>Routing Constraints...</b> 
button.&#160; For a description of each constraint option, read the
<a href="63_RoutingConstraints.htm#top">Routing Constraints</a> section of this 
help file.</span></p>
        <p>The Modeler's diversity constraints <span>provide a means of 
maintaining conduit and/or node diversity during the routing process.&#160;&#160; To select options for 
diversity constraints, click on the <b>Diversity Constraints...</b> button. The 
dialog shown below will appear:</span></p>
        <p><span>&#160;</span>
            <img border="0" src="Resources/images/DiversityConstraints.bmp" width="248" height="217" />
        </p>
        <p><span>
The impact each diversity constraint option has on the routing process is 
described below.</span>
        </p><span><h3>Constrain Path Diversity by Conduit</h3><p>Select one of these two options:</p><ul><li><b>Hard</b>: If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause the 
	lightpath to share a conduit with another of this demand's paths, then that 
	lightpath will be not be available for selection in the CurrentLocation 
	LightPaths list.</li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160; If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause 
	the lightpath to share a conduit with another of this demand's paths, then a cost penalty 
	will be assessed on
 the lightpath and it will be displayed in red in the CurrentLocation 
	LightPaths list. </li></ul><h3>Constrain Path Diversity by Node</h3><p>This option is enabled only when the demand's NodeProtection property is set 
to True.&#160; Select one of these two options:</p><ul><li><b>Hard</b>: If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause the 
	lightpath to share a node with another of this demand's paths, then that 
	lightpath will be not be available for selection in the CurrentLocation 
	LightPaths list.</li><li><b>Soft:</b>&#160; If routing a given demand over a lightpath will cause 
	the lightpath to share a node with another of this demand's paths, then a cost penalty 
	will be assessed on the lightpath and it will be displayed in red in the 
	CurrentLocation LightPaths list. </li></ul></span>

        <h2><a name="ManRouteCreateNew"></a>Create a New Route</h2>
        <p>To create a new proposed route, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#ManRouteConstraint">Set routing and 
diversity constraints</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="#ManRouteClearAll">Clear existing path information</a>, if it exists.&#160; 
	</li>
            <li>From the CurrentLocation LightPaths list, select the desired lightpath and 
double-click on it.&#160; Lightpaths are ranked based on cost, with the lowest 
	cost selection at the top of the list. Your selection will be added to the Path LightPaths 
list and it's endpoint will become the new Current Location.&#160; At the same 
time, the CurrentLocation LightPaths field will be updated with lightpaths that 
connect to your previous selection.&#160; </li>
            <li>Continue to select lightpaths until a 
path is established that connects the demand's start and end locations.&#160; At 
any point during the selection process, you can click on the <b>Find Shortest Path From CurrentLocation</b> 
button.&#160; </li>
            <li>When you are satisfied with the path, click on the <b>OK</b> 
button.&#160; When you do so, the demand's routing path will be updated and the 
text "Manually Routed" will be added to it's RoutingNotes property.</li>

        <h2><a name="ManRouteOpacity"></a>Edit Form Opacity</h2>
        <p>Use the <b>Form Opacity</b> slider to reduce the opacity of the manual routing dialog.&#160; This 
functionality is helpful when you want to see the lightpath selections you are 
making highlighted within the network view.&#160; The desired network view must 
be displayed prior to opening the manual routing tool.</p>

        <h2><a name="ManRouteFix"></a>Prevent a Route from being Overwritten</h2>
        <p>When the <b>Fix LightPath Routing </b>option is checked, the 
FixedLightPathRouting property of the demand being edited will be set to True 
when you exit the manual routing tool.&#160; By using this default option you 
prevent the route you have 
selected from being overwritten the next time a routing algorithm executes.&#160; </p>
        <p>When the <b>Fix LightPath TimeSlots </b>option is checked,
<span>

both the FixedLightPathTimeSlots property and the FixedLightPathRouting property of the demand being edited will be set to True 
when you exit the 

</span>

manual routing tool.&#160; By using this default option you prevent the time 
slots assigned during the manual editing process from being overwritten the next 
time a routing algorithm executes.&#160; </p>
        <p>Both the Fix LightPath Routing and the Fix LightPath TimeSlots options are 
selected by default.&#160; While you may opt to fix lightpath routing without 
also fixing time slots, you cannot fix time slots without also fixing lightpath 
routing.&#160; In other words, the Fix LightPath TimeSlots option must be used 
in conjunction with the Fix LightPath Routing option.<span>&#160;

        <h2><a name="ManRouteReset"></a>Reset the Manual Routing Tool</h2>
        <p>When you reset the Manual Routing tool, you return it to the state it was in 
when you first opened it.&#160; This removes all of the edits you made to the 
route since opening the tool and restores any route information that was 
present.&#160; To reset the Manual Routing tool, click 
the <b>Reset</b> button on the right side of the dialog.</p>

        <h2><a name="ManRouteExam"></a>Manual Routing Example</h2>
        <p>This example will guide you through the process of manually routing the 
working path of a previously routed demand named D_75.&#160; Prior to opening 
the tool, you may wish to open a network view to help you visualize potential 
routes during the manual routing process.&#160; The next step is to select a 
demand and open the tool.&#160; Upon opening, the Manual Routing tool displays 
the existing path information for the demand as shown below.&#160; In this case, 
we want to create a new route that avoids the location Kansas City, which is 
also present in this demand's protect path.&#160; </p>
        <p>Prior to editing the route itself, select the desired settings for both 
<a href="#ManRouteConstraint">Routing and Diversity constraints</a>.&#160; </p>
        <p class="FigureTitle">Manual Route Tool - Open Dialog</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="Resources/images/ManualRouteOpenDialog.bmp" width="776" height="537" />
        </p>
        <p>The next step in the process of creating a new route is to delete all or part 
of the existing route.&#160; For this example, we will retain the first 
lightpath in the existing route, and remove the remaining lightpaths.&#160; To 
accomplish this, click on the second lightpath in the list: LP_Kansas City_St. 
Louis as shown below. </p>
        <p class="FigureTitle">Edit Demand Working Path - Select LightPaths to
Clear</p>
        <p class="FigureTitle">
            <img border="0" src="Resources/images/ManualRouteExam2.bmp" width="776" height="473" />
        </p>
Next, click on the <b>Clear All/Selected LightPaths</b> button to remove the 
selected lightpaths as shown below.
<p class="FigureTitle">Edit Demand Working Path - After Selected
LightPaths are Cleared</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/ManualRouteExam3.bmp" width="776" height="473" /></p>
The CurrentLocation LightPaths frame now shows St. Louis as the CurrentLocation and the 
lightpaths listed below it are those that
 connect St. Louis to other locations in the network.&#160;Any lightpaths 
that violate the hard constraints we selected do not appear in the list. Any 
lightpaths that violate the soft constraints we selected ( in this case, none) 
appear in the list in red text. <p> To add a LightPath to the
Path LightPaths list, double-click on
 the desired lightpath in the CurrentLightPaths list (top half of dialog). In this example if you double-clicked on the LP_Nashville_St. 
Louis, the
 dialog would be updated to look like the one below.</p><p class="FigureTitle">Edit Demand Working Path - Add LightPath to Route</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/ManualRouteExam4.bmp" width="776" height="487" /></p>
Simply repeat the process of selecting lightpaths and double-clicking on them to 
create the desired route. To better visualize potential paths, you can adjust 
form opacity to reveal any network views on display beneath the tool.&#160; At 
any point in the selection process, you can:<ul><li>Click on the <b>Add
 Shortest Path from CurrentLocation</b> and the Modeler will find the 
	shortest path to the end location for you.</li><li>Click on the <b>Reset</b> button if you are unhappy with the path the 
	proposed route is taking and want to restart the selection process from the 
	beginning.</li><li>Remove one or more lightpaths in the proposed route using the <b>Clear 
	All/Selected LightPaths</b> button.</li></ul><p>The proposed route is complete when it connects the demand's start location 
to it's end location as shown below.&#160; Click the <b>OK</b> button to save 
the proposed route and exit the tool.</p><p class="FigureTitle">Edit Demand Working Path - Proposed Route Complete</p><p class="FigureTitle"><img border="0" src="Resources/images/ManualRouteExam5.bmp" width="783" height="548" /></p><p class="BackToTopLink"><a href="#ManRouteTop">Back to top</a></p><hr /></body>
